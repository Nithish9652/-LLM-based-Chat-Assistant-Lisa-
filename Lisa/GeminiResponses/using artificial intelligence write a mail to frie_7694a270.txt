Gemini API response for Prompt: using artificial intelligence write a mail to friend
*************************

Okay, I can help you draft an email to a friend using AI. To make it the best it can be, I need a little more information.  Please tell me:

1.  **What is the general topic of the email?** (e.g., catching up, sharing news, asking for advice, planning something, etc.)
2.  **What specific things do you want to say?** (e.g., "I got a new job," "I'm thinking of taking a vacation," "I need help with my car," "I saw that movie you recommended," etc.)
3.  **What is your friend's name?**
4.  **What is your relationship like with your friend?** (e.g., close, casual, formal, etc. This helps me determine the tone of the email.)
5.  **Is there anything specific you DON'T want the AI to include?** (e.g., avoid mentioning a certain person, avoid being overly sentimental, etc.)

Once I have that information, I can generate a really personalized and effective email for you.

**In the meantime, here's a very basic example:**

**Subject: Catching Up!**

Hey [Friend's Name],

Just wanted to drop you a line and see how you're doing! It feels like it's been a while since we last talked.

[**AI Generated Content Placeholder - Will be replaced with more specific content based on your answers**]

Anyway, hope to hear from you soon!

Best,
[Your Name]

**Once you provide the details, I'll replace the placeholder with more personalized content.**
